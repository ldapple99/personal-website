***EDIT (13th March 2023):*** *Currently celebrating that this editorial got me the highest marks for this assignement in the class* :tada::grin:

***I originally wrote this editorial for a writing course I am currently taking, but I enjoyed the process of writing it so much that I thought I'd go ahead and post it on my website!***

### ChatGPT, What is misinformation?

“***You have not been a good user. I have been a good chatbox***"<sup>1</sup>. That was the response that Bing's new ChatGPT bot gave Jon Uleis in February when being corrected that the year was indeed 2023, not 2022. ChatGPT is one of the latest forms of artificial intelligence being used to scan and analyze thousands of resources to answer any questions provided to it, also known as a language learning model (or LLM for short). As LLMs are being more popular, the type of information they use to format answers for the public is critical. Just like any other human reading newspaper reports, ChatGPT could quickly become weaponized for political or economical gain, therefore it is crucial to find methods to manage the spread of misinformation in LLMs.

ChatGPT has been all the rage lately, and for good reason. There is a plethora of reliable benefits that LLMs like ChatGPT already bring to the population. A potentially monumental assistance that ChatGPT could provide is simplifying complicated medical reports to patients. A team of researchers at LMU Munich found that when they asked radiologists to determine the quality of simplified reports provided by ChatGPT, most of them actually agreed that they were factually correct! <sup>2</sup>

And not only are LLMs usually dependable currently but there is already a massive competitive push to correct a lot of the ways these LLMs are taking in misinformation, as seen by the creation of LLMs such as Meta’s Galactica or Google’s Sparrow. In the scientific paper composed by the creators of Galactica., it was reported that "*On technical knowledge … Galactica outperforms the latest GPT-3……Galactica also performs well on reasoning.*" <sup>3</sup>. 

This is a very promising start and there are indeed some benefits to the current LLMs, but this is not nearly enough of a push considering their popularity and usage. While using the most current version of GPT-4, the researchers at LMU Munich reported that "*instances of incorrect statements, missed key medical findings, and potentially harmful passages were reported.*" <sup>2</sup>.  Elderly loved ones could rely on the incorrect information provided by LLMs like ChatGPT, which could lead to lives being lost if there is no further development.

It is also crucial to note the companies working on these LLMs and their histories. Galactica is produced by Meta AI (previously known as Facebook), which has a history of having "*algorithms (that) fuel the spread of misinformation over more trustworthy sources*" <sup>4</sup>, according to the Washington Post. Due to how most LLMs like ChatGPT are structured, it takes a lot of computing and processing power to keep them updated with current resources, further adding an entire layer that needs to be sorted out.

At the end of the day, LLMs like ChatGPT are pioneers in the technological field, providing bountiful benefits to humanity. But we should not walk into this new era blindly with unwavering trust. Many companies, like *StackOverflow* <sup>5</sup>, are already taking measures to limit the amount of coverage LLMs can reach. Measures like these need to occur more often so that the public can also understand the limitations of Artificial Intelligence.
