### ChatGPT, What is misinformation?

***â€œYou have not been a good user. I have been a good chatbox"***^1^. That was the response that ChatGPT gave Jon Uleis in February when being corrected that the year was indeed 2023, not 2022. ChatGPT is one of the latest forms of artificial intelligence being used to scan and analyze thousands of resources to answer any questions provided to it, also known as a language learning model (or LLM for short). As LLMs are being more popular, the type of information they use to format answers for the public is critical. Just like any other human reading newspaper reports, ChatGPT could quickly become weaponized for political or economical gain, therefore it is crucial to find methods to manage the spread of misinformation in LLMs.
