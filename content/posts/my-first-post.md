#### Hello!

My name is *Laura* and this is my very first blog post! :tada:

T﻿his post was mostly used for testing. But I figured I may as well use it to tell a little bit more about myself. :smile:

I﻿ am a student who's attending the beautiful University of Colorado, Boulder. May 2023 is when I am planning on graduating with my bachelor's in interdisciplinary Physics with double minors in both Computer Science and Mathematics. I will forever be grateful for the wide breadth of applicable knowledge that CU has provided me with. Currently, I want to grow my career into the Software Industry which would allow me to further develop and apply the various skills that I have immensely enjoyed discovering during my time in university. I would love to be able to apply many of the problem solving skills that my experience with physics and mathematics has taught me within the software community.
