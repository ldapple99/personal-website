#### Hello!

My name is *Laura* and this is my very first blog post on my website! :tada: 

T﻿his post was mostly used for testing. But I figured I may as well use it to tell a little bit more about myself. :smile:

I﻿ am a student who's attending the beautiful University of Colorado, Boulder. May 2023 is when I am planning on graduating with my bachelor's in Interdisciplinary Physics with double minors in both Computer Science and Mathematics. I will forever be grateful for the wide breadth of applicable knowledge that CU has provided me with. Currently, I want to grow my career in the Software Industry which would allow me to further develop and apply the various skills that I have immensely enjoyed discovering during my time in university. I would love to be able to apply many of the problem-solving skills from my experience with physics and mathematics within the software community.

A﻿s an accomplished pianist, I love spending my free time learning how to play a wide variety of music. Whether it be a somber movie soundtrack piece or a jolly holiday song to sing along to with the family, piano playing has always been a peaceful experience for me that brings me much joy. I also quite enjoy cooking, reading (pretty much anything, I love all genres! :laughing:), and playing video games (*Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask* being my absolute favorite :smile: The storyline is so interesting!).

I﻿ also really love photography and traveling; being able to capture an experience and reminiscing on it in the future brings both me and my loved ones much joy. I'll include some photos below that I had taken during my travels to both New York City and Las Vegas in the past couple of years.
