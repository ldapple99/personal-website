***Happy January everyone!*** :snowflake:

I thought I'd start off my first ***Confusion of the Month*** - a monthly column that will discuss a topic that I came across that intially bewildered me and how I made sense of it - with a fun subject that I had recently became aware of. This subject being ***Esoteric Programming Languages*** and why I am more than glad that I never had an assignment programming in one during my time as an undergraduate student (*so far* I should say, still have 3 months to go till I graduate :eyes:).
