**Hello & Happy February Everyone! :snowflake: **

In my Computer Systems course, this month has been dedicated towards learning and understanding lower-level Assembly Language (specifically x86-64). Although it initially confused me, as I started learning more and more about assembly I realised all of the wonderful benefits it can bring. In the Computer Systems course I am currently in, we used assembly paired with GDB (General GNU Project Debugger) to determine and debug simple programs in C. And although assembly is generally not used to directly debug programs, being able to grasp what assembly is and gain the the knowledge on how to use it can providde a plethora of benefits, including but not limited to:
- better understanding how programs often work at lower-levels
- being able to write smoother performing algorithms
- gaining more knowledge on how Input/Ouput Operations and Buffering actually works
- having the capability of writing more back-end for the compiler
- and many, many more.
